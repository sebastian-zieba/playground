# getting ssh to work

TERMINAL ON MACHINE:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "zieba@mpia-hd.mpg.de"
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

COPY THE KEY 
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub

OR USE CLIP

sudo apt-get install xclip
xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub


GO TO GITHUB AND ENTER THE CODE IN THE SETTINGS

GO TO .git/config AND MODIFY THE url TO LOOK LIKE THAT
        url = git@github.com:sebastian-zieba/playground.git

FINALLY, ADD github.com AS A KNOWN HOST
ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

ssh should work now.
